    docs: | 
      The sandbox is designed to mimic the production environment, with a few exceptions. 
      Loan agreements created in the sandbox will have large `draft` watermarks and funds flows will only occur in production. 
      Sandbox API keys are prefixed with `test_` while production API keys are  prefixed with `prod_`.
