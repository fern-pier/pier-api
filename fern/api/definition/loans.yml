        Once an application is accepted, the final step to complete the application process is for the applicant to execute the loan agreement. 
        The loan agreement object contains a `document_url` where the agreement is hosted and can have a status of `pending_signature`, `signed`, or `expired`. 
        Loan agreements that are not signed within 24 hours expire and need to be re-created
